# Futoshiki-Solver
Futoshiki-Solver

Done in Python, takes in an input of a board state, and outputs a possible solution to the puzzle.

The input board state takes the form of 3 boards, one 5 x 5 board of numbers ranging from 0-5. 0 indicates an empty spot
The second board is a 5 x 4 board, which shows the positions of the horizontal constraints between adjacent cells.
The third board is a 4 x 5 board, which shows the positions of vertical constraints.

3 examples of possible inputs are included in the repo

If there is a possible solution to the board state given, the program creates a text file with a 5 x 5 filled board with values ranging from 1-5.

Example outputs are also included in the repo
